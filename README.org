Research project about inventing new type of state container where
everything (including IO and rendering) is represented as data and
processed by rule based engine

** What

- Explicit intermediate state
- Controlled IO
- Automatic error handling/propagation
- Automatic test generation
- Should be able to answer WHY certain thing had happened
- Should be able to answer WHAT-IF certain thing would happen differently
- Should be able to answer WHAT COULD happen next on any given moment

** How

- One global EAV data storage
- Clojure.spec support
- Model driven development
- IO represented as data
- Notion of time/data age
- Model driven development to generate acceptance tests
- f(state) -> [possible events] for generating test explorers

** Status

Gathering requirements, first ideas of what it could become
