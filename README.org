Research project about inventing "silver bullet" that would solve all
software development problems. Obviously it's not possible but very
fun anycase

** What

- Should be able to answer WHY certain thing had happened
- Should be able to answer WHAT-IF certain thing would happen differently
- Should be able to answer WHAT COULD happen next on any given moment
- Continious development - change code and see how app behaviour has
  changed comparing to previous version
- Logs/monitoring/contract validation from the box
- Alternative rules - there are many cases where certain things could
  be acheived via multiple ways

** How

- Automatic test generation
- Automatic error handling/propagation
- Controlled IO, which is represented as data
- One global EAV data storage.  has
- Explicit intermediate state
- Model driven development
- Notion of time/data age
- Model driven development to generate acceptance tests
- f(state) -> [possible events] for generating test explorers
- Monitoring data is application heartbit
- Moniroting data is test data

** Status

Gathering requirements, first ideas of what it could become
